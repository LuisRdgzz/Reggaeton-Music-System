# Reggaeton Music Information System

As a passionate lover of reggaeton music and Puerto Rican culture, I have developed a mini system designed to provide comprehensive information about various aspects of the reggaeton genre. This system allows users to explore details about albums, artists, producers, and record labels, each with its own CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
